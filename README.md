# Python List Operations

This repository contains a Python script demonstrating basic list operations.

## Objective

The script performs the following operations on a Python list (`my_list`):
- Create an empty list.
- Append elements 10, 20, 30, and 40.
- Insert 15 at the second position (index 1).
- Extend the list with [50, 60, 70].
- Remove the last element.
- Sort the list in ascending order.
- Find and print the index of value 30.
- Print the final list.

## Project Structure

- `list_operations.py`: The Python script with the list operations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - No additional dependencies.

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python list_operations.py
   ```

## Expected Output

```
The index vaulue of 30 on my list is 2
The final list is: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```

## Code Explanation

The script (`list_operations.py`) performs:
1. Creates `my_list` as an empty list.
2. Appends `10`, `20`, `30`, `40` using `append()`.
3. Inserts `15` at index 1 using `insert()`.
4. Extends with `[50, 60, 70]` using `extend()`.
5. Removes the last element (`70`) using `pop()`.
6. Sorts the list using `sort()`.
7. Finds the index of `30` using `index()` and prints it.
8. Prints the final list.

```
Tt perform a series of operations on a Python list (my_list) as follows:

Create an empty list.
Append the elements 10, 20, 30, and 40.
Insert 15 at the second position (index 1).
Extend the list with another list containing 50, 60, and 70.
Remove the last element.
Sort the list in ascending order.
Find and print the index of the value 30.
Print the final list to verify all operations.

Project Structure

list_operations.py: The Python script containing the list operations.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


Requirements:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
No additional dependencies are required.


Run the Script:

Execute the Python script:python list_operations.py


Expected Output
Running the script will produce the following output:
The index vaulue of 30 on my list is 2
The final list is: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

Code Explanation
The script (list_operations.py) performs the following operations:

Creates an empty list called my_list.
Appends the values 10, 20, 30, and 40 using the append() method.
Inserts 15 at index 1 using the insert() method.
Extends the list with [50, 60, 70] using the extend() method.
Removes the last element (70) using the pop() method.
Sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
Finds the index of 30 using the index() method and prints it.
Prints the final list to verify all operations.
